# A tool to fetch all the patches in the PRs for a milestone. Used for making
# stable releases for Meson with `git am <patch>`.
#
# TODO: We currently fetch patches from the PR instead of the patches that went
# into the master branch of the repository. This means that f.ex., squashed PRs
# are not handled correctly. Maybe we should fetch SHAs from the repository
# instead and use `git cherry-pick` instead. It's easier to resolve conflicts
# this way.
